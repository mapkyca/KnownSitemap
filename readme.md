Known Sitemap
=============

This is a quick tool that will automatically generate and maintain a (basic) site map for your site.

Sitemaps are specially crafted XML files, usually located at https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml, that help search engines better crawl your site.

When you first visit your sitemap.xml file a sitemap will be generated and cached and your robots.txt will be updated accordingly. 

When you create new posts, this file will be automatically updated.
